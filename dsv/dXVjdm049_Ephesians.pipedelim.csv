    Ephesians:
    

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"001"|"Paul; an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God; to the saints which are at Ephesus; and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"002"|"Grace be to you; and peace; from God our Father; and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"003"|"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"004"|"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world; that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"005"|"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself; according to the good pleasure of his will;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"006"|"To the praise of the glory of his grace; wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"007"|"In whom we have redemption through his blood; the forgiveness of sins; according to the riches of his grace;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"008"|"Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"009"|"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will; according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"010"|"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ; both which are in heaven; and which are on earth; even in him:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"011"|"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance; being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"012"|"That we should be to the praise of his glory; who first trusted in Christ."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"013"|"In whom ye also trusted; after that ye heard the word of truth; the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed; ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"014"|"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession; unto the praise of his glory."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"015"|"Wherefore I also; after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus; and love unto all the saints;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"016"|"Cease not to give thanks for you; making mention of you in my prayers;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"017"|"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ; the Father of glory; may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"018"|"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling; and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"019"|"And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe; according to the working of his mighty power;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"020"|"Which he wrought in Christ; when he raised him from the dead; and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"021"|"Far above all principality; and power; and might; and dominion; and every name that is named; not only in this world; but also in that which is to come:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"022"|"And hath put all things under his feet; and gave him to be the head over all things to the church;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"1"|"023"|"Which is his body; the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
                
    

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"001"|"And you hath he quickened; who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"002"|"Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world; according to the prince of the power of the air; the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"003"|"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh; fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath; even as others."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"004"|"But God; who is rich in mercy; for his great love wherewith he loved us;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"005"|"Even when we were dead in sins; hath quickened us together with Christ; (by grace ye are saved;)"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"006"|"And hath raised us up together; and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"007"|"That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"008"|"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"009"|"Not of works; lest any man should boast."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"010"|"For we are his workmanship; created in Christ Jesus unto good works; which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"011"|"Wherefore remember; that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh; who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"012"|"That at that time ye were without Christ; being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel; and strangers from the covenants of promise; having no hope; and without God in the world:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"013"|"But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"014"|"For he is our peace; who hath made both one; and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"015"|"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity; even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man; so making peace;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"016"|"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross; having slain the enmity thereby:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"017"|"And came and preached peace to you which were afar off; and to them that were nigh."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"018"|"For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"019"|"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners; but fellowcitizens with the saints; and of the household of God;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"020"|"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets; Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"021"|"In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"2"|"022"|"In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."
                
    

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"001"|"For this cause I Paul; the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"002"|"If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"003"|"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"004"|"Whereby; when ye read; ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"005"|"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men; as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"006"|"That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs; and of the same body; and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"007"|"Whereof I was made a minister; according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"008"|"Unto me; who am less than the least of all saints; is this grace given; that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"009"|"And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery; which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God; who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"010"|"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"011"|"According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"012"|"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"013"|"Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you; which is your glory."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"014"|"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"015"|"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"016"|"That he would grant you; according to the riches of his glory; to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"017"|"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye; being rooted and grounded in love;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"018"|"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth; and length; and depth; and height;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"019"|"And to know the love of Christ; which passeth knowledge; that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"020"|"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think; according to the power that worketh in us;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"3"|"021"|"Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages; world without end. Amen."
                
    

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"001"|"I therefore; the prisoner of the Lord; beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"002"|"With all lowliness and meekness; with longsuffering; forbearing one another in love;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"003"|"Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"004"|"There is one body; and one Spirit; even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"005"|"One Lord; one faith; one baptism;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"006"|"One God and Father of all; who is above all; and through all; and in you all."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"007"|"But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"008"|"Wherefore he saith; When he ascended up on high; he led captivity captive; and gave gifts unto men."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"009"|"(Now that he ascended; what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"010"|"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens; that he might fill all things.)"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"011"|"And he gave some; apostles; and some; prophets; and some; evangelists; and some; pastors and teachers;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"012"|"For the perfecting of the saints; for the work of the ministry; for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"013"|"Till we all come in the unity of the faith; and of the knowledge of the Son of God; unto a perfect man; unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"014"|"That we henceforth be no more children; tossed to and fro; and carried about with every wind of doctrine; by the sleight of men; and cunning craftiness; whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"015"|"But speaking the truth in love; may grow up into him in all things; which is the head; even Christ:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"016"|"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth; according to the effectual working in the measure of every part; maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"017"|"This I say therefore; and testify in the Lord; that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk; in the vanity of their mind;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"018"|"Having the understanding darkened; being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them; because of the blindness of their heart:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"019"|"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness; to work all uncleanness with greediness."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"020"|"But ye have not so learned Christ;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"021"|"If so be that ye have heard him; and have been taught by him; as the truth is in Jesus:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"022"|"That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man; which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"023"|"And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"024"|"And that ye put on the new man; which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"025"|"Wherefore putting away lying; speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"026"|"Be ye angry; and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"027"|"Neither give place to the devil."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"028"|"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour; working with his hands the thing which is good; that he may have to give to him that needeth."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"029"|"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth; but that which is good to the use of edifying; that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"030"|"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God; whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"031"|"Let all bitterness; and wrath; and anger; and clamour; and evil speaking; be put away from you; with all malice:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"4"|"032"|"And be ye kind one to another; tenderhearted; forgiving one another; even as God for Christ2019s sake hath forgiven you."
                
    

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"001"|"Be ye therefore followers of God; as dear children;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"002"|"And walk in love; as Christ also hath loved us; and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"003"|"But fornication; and all uncleanness; or covetousness; let it not be once named among you; as becometh saints;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"004"|"Neither filthiness; nor foolish talking; nor jesting; which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"005"|"For this ye know; that no whoremonger; nor unclean person; nor covetous man; who is an idolater; hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"006"|"Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"007"|"Be not ye therefore partakers with them."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"008"|"For ye were sometimes darkness; but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"009"|"(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"010"|"Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"011"|"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; but rather reprove them."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"012"|"For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"013"|"But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"014"|"Wherefore he saith; Awake thou that sleepest; and arise from the dead; and Christ shall give thee light."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"015"|"See then that ye walk circumspectly; not as fools; but as wise;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"016"|"Redeeming the time; because the days are evil."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"017"|"Wherefore be ye not unwise; but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"018"|"And be not drunk with wine; wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"019"|"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"020"|"Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"021"|"Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"022"|"Wives; submit yourselves unto your own husbands; as unto the Lord."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"023"|"For the husband is the head of the wife; even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"024"|"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ; so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"025"|"Husbands; love your wives; even as Christ also loved the church; and gave himself for it;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"026"|"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"027"|"That he might present it to himself a glorious church; not having spot; or wrinkle; or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"028"|"So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"029"|"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it; even as the Lord the church:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"030"|"For we are members of his body; of his flesh; and of his bones."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"031"|"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother; and shall be joined unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"032"|"This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"5"|"033"|"Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband."
                
    

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"001"|"Children; obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"002"|"Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"003"|"That it may be well with thee; and thou mayest live long on the earth."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"004"|"And; ye fathers; provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"005"|"Servants; be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh; with fear and trembling; in singleness of your heart; as unto Christ;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"006"|"Not with eyeservice; as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ; doing the will of God from the heart;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"007"|"With good will doing service; as to the Lord; and not to men:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"008"|"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth; the same shall he receive of the Lord; whether he be bond or free."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"009"|"And; ye masters; do the same things unto them; forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"010"|"Finally; my brethren; be strong in the Lord; and in the power of his might."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"011"|"Put on the whole armour of God; that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"012"|"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood; but against principalities; against powers; against the rulers of the darkness of this world; against spiritual wickedness in high places."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"013"|"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God; that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day; and having done all; to stand."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"014"|"Stand therefore; having your loins girt about with truth; and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"015"|"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"016"|"Above all; taking the shield of faith; wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"017"|"And take the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit; which is the word of God:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"018"|"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit; and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"019"|"And for me; that utterance may be given unto me; that I may open my mouth boldly; to make known the mystery of the gospel;"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"020"|"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly; as I ought to speak."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"021"|"But that ye also may know my affairs; and how I do; Tychicus; a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord; shall make known to you all things:"
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"022"|"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose; that ye might know our affairs; and that he might comfort your hearts."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"023"|"Peace be to the brethren; and love with faith; from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
        

          "Ephesians"|"49"|"6"|"024"|"Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen."
