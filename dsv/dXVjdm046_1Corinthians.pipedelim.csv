    1Corinthians:
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"001"|"Paul; called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God; and Sosthenes our brother;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"002"|"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth; to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus; called to be saints; with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord; both theirs and ours:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"003"|"Grace be unto you; and peace; from God our Father; and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"004"|"I thank my God always on your behalf; for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"005"|"That in every thing ye are enriched by him; in all utterance; and in all knowledge;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"006"|"Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"007"|"So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"008"|"Who shall also confirm you unto the end; that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"009"|"God is faithful; by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"010"|"Now I beseech you; brethren; by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; that ye all speak the same thing; and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"011"|"For it hath been declared unto me of you; my brethren; by them which are of the house of Chloe; that there are contentions among you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"012"|"Now this I say; that every one of you saith; I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"013"|"Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"014"|"I thank God that I baptized none of you; but Crispus and Gaius;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"015"|"Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"016"|"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides; I know not whether I baptized any other."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"017"|"For Christ sent me not to baptize; but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words; lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"018"|"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"019"|"For it is written; I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"020"|"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"021"|"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God; it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"022"|"For the Jews require a sign; and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"023"|"But we preach Christ crucified; unto the Jews a stumblingblock; and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"024"|"But unto them which are called; both Jews and Greeks; Christ the power of God; and the wisdom of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"025"|"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"026"|"For ye see your calling; brethren; how that not many wise men after the flesh; not many mighty; not many noble; are called:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"027"|"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"028"|"And base things of the world; and things which are despised; hath God chosen; yea; and things which are not; to bring to nought things that are:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"029"|"That no flesh should glory in his presence."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"030"|"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus; who of God is made unto us wisdom; and righteousness; and sanctification; and redemption:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"1"|"031"|"That; according as it is written; He that glorieth; let him glory in the Lord."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"001"|"And I; brethren; when I came to you; came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom; declaring unto you the testimony of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"002"|"For I determined not to know any thing among you; save Jesus Christ; and him crucified."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"003"|"And I was with you in weakness; and in fear; and in much trembling."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"004"|"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man2019s wisdom; but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"005"|"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men; but in the power of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"006"|"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world; nor of the princes of this world; that come to nought:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"007"|"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery; even the hidden wisdom; which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"008"|"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it; they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"009"|"But as it is written; Eye hath not seen; nor ear heard; neither have entered into the heart of man; the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"010"|"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things; yea; the deep things of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"011"|"For what man knoweth the things of a man; save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man; but the Spirit of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"012"|"Now we have received; not the spirit of the world; but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"013"|"Which things also we speak; not in the words which man2019s wisdom teacheth; but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"014"|"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them; because they are spiritually discerned."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"015"|"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things; yet he himself is judged of no man."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"2"|"016"|"For who hath known the mind of the Lord; that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"001"|"And I; brethren; could not speak unto you as unto spiritual; but as unto carnal; even as unto babes in Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"002"|"I have fed you with milk; and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it; neither yet now are ye able."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"003"|"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying; and strife; and divisions; are ye not carnal; and walk as men?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"004"|"For while one saith; I am of Paul; and another; I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"005"|"Who then is Paul; and who is Apollos; but ministers by whom ye believed; even as the Lord gave to every man?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"006"|"I have planted; Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"007"|"So then neither is he that planteth any thing; neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"008"|"Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"009"|"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God2019s husbandry; ye are God2019s building."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"010"|"According to the grace of God which is given unto me; as a wise masterbuilder; I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"011"|"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid; which is Jesus Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"012"|"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold; silver; precious stones; wood; hay; stubble;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"013"|"Every man2019s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it; because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man2019s work of what sort it is."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"014"|"If any man2019s work abide which he hath built thereupon; he shall receive a reward."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"015"|"If any man2019s work shall be burned; he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"016"|"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God; and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"017"|"If any man defile the temple of God; him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy; which temple ye are."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"018"|"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world; let him become a fool; that he may be wise."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"019"|"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written; He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"020"|"And again; The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise; that they are vain."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"021"|"Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"022"|"Whether Paul; or Apollos; or Cephas; or the world; or life; or death; or things present; or things to come; all are yours;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"3"|"023"|"And ye are Christ2019s; and Christ is God2019s."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"001"|"Let a man so account of us; as of the ministers of Christ; and stewards of the mysteries of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"002"|"Moreover it is required in stewards; that a man be found faithful."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"003"|"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you; or of man2019s judgment: yea; I judge not mine own self."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"004"|"For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"005"|"Therefore judge nothing before the time; until the Lord come; who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness; and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"006"|"And these things; brethren; I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written; that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"007"|"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it; why dost thou glory; as if thou hadst not received it?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"008"|"Now ye are full; now ye are rich; ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign; that we also might reign with you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"009"|"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last; as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world; and to angels; and to men."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"010"|"We are fools for Christ2019s sake; but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak; but ye are strong; ye are honourable; but we are despised."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"011"|"Even unto this present hour we both hunger; and thirst; and are naked; and are buffeted; and have no certain dwellingplace;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"012"|"And labour; working with our own hands: being reviled; we bless; being persecuted; we suffer it:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"013"|"Being defamed; we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world; and are the offscouring of all things unto this day."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"014"|"I write not these things to shame you; but as my beloved sons I warn you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"015"|"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ; yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"016"|"Wherefore I beseech you; be ye followers of me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"017"|"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus; who is my beloved son; and faithful in the Lord; who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ; as I teach every where in every church."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"018"|"Now some are puffed up; as though I would not come to you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"019"|"But I will come to you shortly; if the Lord will; and will know; not the speech of them which are puffed up; but the power."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"020"|"For the kingdom of God is not in word; but in power."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"4"|"021"|"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod; or in love; and in the spirit of meekness?"
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"001"|"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you; and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles; that one should have his father2019s wife."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"002"|"And ye are puffed up; and have not rather mourned; that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"003"|"For I verily; as absent in body; but present in spirit; have judged already; as though I were present; concerning him that hath so done this deed;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"004"|"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; when ye are gathered together; and my spirit; with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"005"|"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh; that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"006"|"Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"007"|"Purge out therefore the old leaven; that ye may be a new lump; as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"008"|"Therefore let us keep the feast; not with old leaven; neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"009"|"I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"010"|"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world; or with the covetous; or extortioners; or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"011"|"But now I have written unto you not to keep company; if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator; or covetous; or an idolater; or a railer; or a drunkard; or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"012"|"For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"5"|"013"|"But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"001"|"Dare any of you; having a matter against another; go to law before the unjust; and not before the saints?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"002"|"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you; are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"003"|"Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"004"|"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life; set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"005"|"I speak to your shame. Is it so; that there is not a wise man among you? no; not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"006"|"But brother goeth to law with brother; and that before the unbelievers."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"007"|"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you; because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"008"|"Nay; ye do wrong; and defraud; and that your brethren."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"009"|"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators; nor idolaters; nor adulterers; nor effeminate; nor abusers of themselves with mankind;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"010"|"Nor thieves; nor covetous; nor drunkards; nor revilers; nor extortioners; shall inherit the kingdom of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"011"|"And such were some of you: but ye are washed; but ye are sanctified; but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus; and by the Spirit of our God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"012"|"All things are lawful unto me; but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"013"|"Meats for the belly; and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication; but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"014"|"And God hath both raised up the Lord; and will also raise up us by his own power."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"015"|"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ; and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"016"|"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two; saith he; shall be one flesh."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"017"|"But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"018"|"Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"019"|"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you; which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"6"|"020"|"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body; and in your spirit; which are God2019s."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"001"|"Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"002"|"Nevertheless; to avoid fornication; let every man have his own wife; and let every woman have her own husband."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"003"|"Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"004"|"The wife hath not power of her own body; but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body; but the wife."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"005"|"Defraud ye not one the other; except it be with consent for a time; that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again; that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"006"|"But I speak this by permission; and not of commandment."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"007"|"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God; one after this manner; and another after that."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"008"|"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows; It is good for them if they abide even as I."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"009"|"But if they cannot contain; let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"010"|"And unto the married I command; yet not I; but the Lord; Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"011"|"But and if she depart; let her remain unmarried; or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"012"|"But to the rest speak I; not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not; and she be pleased to dwell with him; let him not put her away."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"013"|"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not; and if he be pleased to dwell with her; let her not leave him."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"014"|"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"015"|"But if the unbelieving depart; let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"016"|"For what knowest thou; O wife; whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou; O man; whether thou shalt save thy wife?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"017"|"But as God hath distributed to every man; as the Lord hath called every one; so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"018"|"Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"019"|"Circumcision is nothing; and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"020"|"Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"021"|"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free; use it rather."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"022"|"For he that is called in the Lord; being a servant; is the Lord2019s freeman: likewise also he that is called; being free; is Christ2019s servant."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"023"|"Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"024"|"Brethren; let every man; wherein he is called; therein abide with God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"025"|"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment; as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"026"|"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress; I say; that it is good for a man so to be."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"027"|"Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"028"|"But and if thou marry; thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry; she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"029"|"But this I say; brethren; the time is short: it remaineth; that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"030"|"And they that weep; as though they wept not; and they that rejoice; as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy; as though they possessed not;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"031"|"And they that use this world; as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"032"|"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord; how he may please the Lord:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"033"|"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world; how he may please his wife."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"034"|"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord; that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world; how she may please her husband."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"035"|"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you; but for that which is comely; and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"036"|"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin; if she pass the flower of her age; and need so require; let him do what he will; he sinneth not: let them marry."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"037"|"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart; having no necessity; but hath power over his own will; and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin; doeth well."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"038"|"So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"039"|"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead; she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"7"|"040"|"But she is happier if she so abide; after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"001"|"Now as touching things offered unto idols; we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"002"|"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing; he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"003"|"But if any man love God; the same is known of him."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"004"|"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols; we know that an idol is nothing in the world; and that there is none other God but one."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"005"|"For though there be that are called gods; whether in heaven or in earth; (as there be gods many; and lords many;)"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"006"|"But to us there is but one God; the Father; of whom are all things; and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ; by whom are all things; and we by him."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"007"|"Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"008"|"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither; if we eat; are we the better; neither; if we eat not; are we the worse."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"009"|"But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"010"|"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol2019s temple; shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"011"|"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish; for whom Christ died?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"012"|"But when ye sin so against the brethren; and wound their weak conscience; ye sin against Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"8"|"013"|"Wherefore; if meat make my brother to offend; I will eat no flesh while the world standeth; lest I make my brother to offend."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"001"|"Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"002"|"If I be not an apostle unto others; yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"003"|"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"004"|"Have we not power to eat and to drink?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"005"|"Have we not power to lead about a sister; a wife; as well as other apostles; and as the brethren of the Lord; and Cephas?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"006"|"Or I only and Barnabas; have not we power to forbear working?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"007"|"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard; and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock; and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"008"|"Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"009"|"For it is written in the law of Moses; Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"010"|"Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes; no doubt; this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"011"|"If we have sown unto you spiritual things; is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"012"|"If others be partakers of this power over you; are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things; lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"013"|"Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"014"|"Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"015"|"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things; that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die; than that any man should make my glorying void."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"016"|"For though I preach the gospel; I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea; woe is unto me; if I preach not the gospel!"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"017"|"For if I do this thing willingly; I have a reward: but if against my will; a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"018"|"What is my reward then? Verily that; when I preach the gospel; I may make the gospel of Christ without charge; that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"019"|"For though I be free from all men; yet have I made myself servant unto all; that I might gain the more."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"020"|"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew; that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law; as under the law; that I might gain them that are under the law;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"021"|"To them that are without law; as without law; (being not without law to God; but under the law to Christ;) that I might gain them that are without law."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"022"|"To the weak became I as weak; that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men; that I might by all means save some."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"023"|"And this I do for the gospel2019s sake; that I might be partaker thereof with you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"024"|"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all; but one receiveth the prize? So run; that ye may obtain."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"025"|"And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"026"|"I therefore so run; not as uncertainly; so fight I; not as one that beateth the air:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"9"|"027"|"But I keep under my body; and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means; when I have preached to others; I myself should be a castaway."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"001"|"Moreover; brethren; I would not that ye should be ignorant; how that all our fathers were under the cloud; and all passed through the sea;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"002"|"And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"003"|"And did all eat the same spiritual meat;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"004"|"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"005"|"But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"006"|"Now these things were our examples; to the intent we should not lust after evil things; as they also lusted."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"007"|"Neither be ye idolaters; as were some of them; as it is written; The people sat down to eat and drink; and rose up to play."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"008"|"Neither let us commit fornication; as some of them committed; and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"009"|"Neither let us tempt Christ; as some of them also tempted; and were destroyed of serpents."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"010"|"Neither murmur ye; as some of them also murmured; and were destroyed of the destroyer."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"011"|"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition; upon whom the ends of the world are come."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"012"|"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"013"|"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful; who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape; that ye may be able to bear it."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"014"|"Wherefore; my dearly beloved; flee from idolatry."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"015"|"I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"016"|"The cup of blessing which we bless; is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break; is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"017"|"For we being many are one bread; and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"018"|"Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"019"|"What say I then? that the idol is any thing; or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"020"|"But I say; that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice; they sacrifice to devils; and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"021"|"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord; and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord2019s table; and of the table of devils."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"022"|"Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"023"|"All things are lawful for me; but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me; but all things edify not."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"024"|"Let no man seek his own; but every man another2019s wealth."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"025"|"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles; that eat; asking no question for conscience sake:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"026"|"For the earth is the Lord2019s; and the fulness thereof."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"027"|"If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast; and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you; eat; asking no question for conscience sake."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"028"|"But if any man say unto you; This is offered in sacrifice unto idols; eat not for his sake that shewed it; and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord2019s; and the fulness thereof:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"029"|"Conscience; I say; not thine own; but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man2019s conscience?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"030"|"For if I by grace be a partaker; why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"031"|"Whether therefore ye eat; or drink; or whatsoever ye do; do all to the glory of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"032"|"Give none offence; neither to the Jews; nor to the Gentiles; nor to the church of God:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"10"|"033"|"Even as I please all men in all things; not seeking mine own profit; but the profit of many; that they may be saved."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"001"|"Be ye followers of me; even as I also am of Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"002"|"Now I praise you; brethren; that ye remember me in all things; and keep the ordinances; as I delivered them to you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"003"|"But I would have you know; that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"004"|"Every man praying or prophesying; having his head covered; dishonoureth his head."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"005"|"But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"006"|"For if the woman be not covered; let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven; let her be covered."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"007"|"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head; forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"008"|"For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"009"|"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"010"|"For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"011"|"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman; neither the woman without the man; in the Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"012"|"For as the woman is of the man; even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"013"|"Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"014"|"Doth not even nature itself teach you; that; if a man have long hair; it is a shame unto him?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"015"|"But if a woman have long hair; it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"016"|"But if any man seem to be contentious; we have no such custom; neither the churches of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"017"|"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not; that ye come together not for the better; but for the worse."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"018"|"For first of all; when ye come together in the church; I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"019"|"For there must be also heresies among you; that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"020"|"When ye come together therefore into one place; this is not to eat the Lord2019s supper."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"021"|"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry; and another is drunken."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"022"|"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God; and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"023"|"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you; That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"024"|"And when he had given thanks; he brake it; and said; Take; eat: this is my body; which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"025"|"After the same manner also he took the cup; when he had supped; saying; This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye; as oft as ye drink it; in remembrance of me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"026"|"For as often as ye eat this bread; and drink this cup; ye do shew the Lord2019s death till he come."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"027"|"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread; and drink this cup of the Lord; unworthily; shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"028"|"But let a man examine himself; and so let him eat of that bread; and drink of that cup."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"029"|"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily; eateth and drinketh damnation to himself; not discerning the Lord2019s body."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"030"|"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you; and many sleep."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"031"|"For if we would judge ourselves; we should not be judged."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"032"|"But when we are judged; we are chastened of the Lord; that we should not be condemned with the world."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"033"|"Wherefore; my brethren; when ye come together to eat; tarry one for another."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"11"|"034"|"And if any man hunger; let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"001"|"Now concerning spiritual gifts; brethren; I would not have you ignorant."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"002"|"Ye know that ye were Gentiles; carried away unto these dumb idols; even as ye were led."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"003"|"Wherefore I give you to understand; that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord; but by the Holy Ghost."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"004"|"Now there are diversities of gifts; but the same Spirit."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"005"|"And there are differences of administrations; but the same Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"006"|"And there are diversities of operations; but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"007"|"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"008"|"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"009"|"To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"010"|"To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"011"|"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit; dividing to every man severally as he will."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"012"|"For as the body is one; and hath many members; and all the members of that one body; being many; are one body: so also is Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"013"|"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body; whether we be Jews or Gentiles; whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"014"|"For the body is not one member; but many."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"015"|"If the foot shall say; Because I am not the hand; I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"016"|"And if the ear shall say; Because I am not the eye; I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"017"|"If the whole body were an eye; where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing; where were the smelling?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"018"|"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body; as it hath pleased him."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"019"|"And if they were all one member; where were the body?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"020"|"But now are they many members; yet but one body."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"021"|"And the eye cannot say unto the hand; I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet; I have no need of you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"022"|"Nay; much more those members of the body; which seem to be more feeble; are necessary:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"023"|"And those members of the body; which we think to be less honourable; upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"024"|"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together; having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"025"|"That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"026"|"And whether one member suffer; all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured; all the members rejoice with it."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"027"|"Now ye are the body of Christ; and members in particular."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"028"|"And God hath set some in the church; first apostles; secondarily prophets; thirdly teachers; after that miracles; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; diversities of tongues."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"029"|"Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"030"|"Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"12"|"031"|"But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"001"|"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels; and have not charity; I am become as sounding brass; or a tinkling cymbal."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"002"|"And though I have the gift of prophecy; and understand all mysteries; and all knowledge; and though I have all faith; so that I could remove mountains; and have not charity; I am nothing."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"003"|"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor; and though I give my body to be burned; and have not charity; it profiteth me nothing."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"004"|"Charity suffereth long; and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"005"|"Doth not behave itself unseemly; seeketh not her own; is not easily provoked; thinketh no evil;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"006"|"Rejoiceth not in iniquity; but rejoiceth in the truth;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"007"|"Beareth all things; believeth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"008"|"Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies; they shall fail; whether there be tongues; they shall cease; whether there be knowledge; it shall vanish away."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"009"|"For we know in part; and we prophesy in part."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"010"|"But when that which is perfect is come; then that which is in part shall be done away."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"011"|"When I was a child; I spake as a child; I understood as a child; I thought as a child: but when I became a man; I put away childish things."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"012"|"For now we see through a glass; darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"13"|"013"|"And now abideth faith; hope; charity; these three; but the greatest of these is charity."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"001"|"Follow after charity; and desire spiritual gifts; but rather that ye may prophesy."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"002"|"For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men; but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"003"|"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification; and exhortation; and comfort."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"004"|"He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"005"|"I would that ye all spake with tongues; but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues; except he interpret; that the church may receive edifying."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"006"|"Now; brethren; if I come unto you speaking with tongues; what shall I profit you; except I shall speak to you either by revelation; or by knowledge; or by prophesying; or by doctrine?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"007"|"And even things without life giving sound; whether pipe or harp; except they give a distinction in the sounds; how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"008"|"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound; who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"009"|"So likewise ye; except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood; how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"010"|"There are; it may be; so many kinds of voices in the world; and none of them is without signification."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"011"|"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice; I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian; and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"012"|"Even so ye; forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts; seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"013"|"Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"014"|"For if I pray in an unknown tongue; my spirit prayeth; but my understanding is unfruitful."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"015"|"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit; and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit; and I will sing with the understanding also."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"016"|"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit; how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks; seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"017"|"For thou verily givest thanks well; but the other is not edified."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"018"|"I thank my God; I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"019"|"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding; that by my voice I might teach others also; than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"020"|"Brethren; be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children; but in understanding be men."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"021"|"In the law it is written; With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me; saith the LORD."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"022"|"Wherefore tongues are for a sign; not to them that believe; but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not; but for them which believe."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"023"|"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place; and all speak with tongues; and there come in those that are unlearned; or unbelievers; will they not say that ye are mad?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"024"|"But if all prophesy; and there come in one that believeth not; or one unlearned; he is convinced of all; he is judged of all:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"025"|"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God; and report that God is in you of a truth."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"026"|"How is it then; brethren? when ye come together; every one of you hath a psalm; hath a doctrine; hath a tongue; hath a revelation; hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"027"|"If any man speak in an unknown tongue; let it be by two; or at the most by three; and that by course; and let one interpret."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"028"|"But if there be no interpreter; let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself; and to God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"029"|"Let the prophets speak two or three; and let the other judge."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"030"|"If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by; let the first hold his peace."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"031"|"For ye may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn; and all may be comforted."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"032"|"And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"033"|"For God is not the author of confusion; but of peace; as in all churches of the saints."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"034"|"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience; as also saith the law."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"035"|"And if they will learn any thing; let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"036"|"What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"037"|"If any man think himself to be a prophet; or spiritual; let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"038"|"But if any man be ignorant; let him be ignorant."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"039"|"Wherefore; brethren; covet to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"14"|"040"|"Let all things be done decently and in order."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"001"|"Moreover; brethren; I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you; which also ye have received; and wherein ye stand;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"002"|"By which also ye are saved; if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you; unless ye have believed in vain."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"003"|"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received; how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"004"|"And that he was buried; and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"005"|"And that he was seen of Cephas; then of the twelve:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"006"|"After that; he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present; but some are fallen asleep."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"007"|"After that; he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"008"|"And last of all he was seen of me also; as of one born out of due time."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"009"|"For I am the least of the apostles; that am not meet to be called an apostle; because I persecuted the church of God."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"010"|"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I; but the grace of God which was with me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"011"|"Therefore whether it were I or they; so we preach; and so ye believed."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"012"|"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead; how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"013"|"But if there be no resurrection of the dead; then is Christ not risen:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"014"|"And if Christ be not risen; then is our preaching vain; and your faith is also vain."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"015"|"Yea; and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up; if so be that the dead rise not."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"016"|"For if the dead rise not; then is not Christ raised:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"017"|"And if Christ be not raised; your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"018"|"Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"019"|"If in this life only we have hope in Christ; we are of all men most miserable."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"020"|"But now is Christ risen from the dead; and become the firstfruits of them that slept."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"021"|"For since by man came death; by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"022"|"For as in Adam all die; even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"023"|"But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ2019s at his coming."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"024"|"Then cometh the end; when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God; even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"025"|"For he must reign; till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"026"|"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"027"|"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him; it is manifest that he is excepted; which did put all things under him."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"028"|"And when all things shall be subdued unto him; then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him; that God may be all in all."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"029"|"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead; if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"030"|"And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"031"|"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD; I die daily."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"032"|"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus; what advantageth it me; if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"033"|"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"034"|"Awake to righteousness; and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"035"|"But some man will say; How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"036"|"Thou fool; that which thou sowest is not quickened; except it die:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"037"|"And that which thou sowest; thou sowest not that body that shall be; but bare grain; it may chance of wheat; or of some other grain:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"038"|"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him; and to every seed his own body."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"039"|"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men; another flesh of beasts; another of fishes; and another of birds."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"040"|"There are also celestial bodies; and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one; and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"041"|"There is one glory of the sun; and another glory of the moon; and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"042"|"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"043"|"It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"044"|"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body; and there is a spiritual body."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"045"|"And so it is written; The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"046"|"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual; but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"047"|"The first man is of the earth; earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"048"|"As is the earthy; such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly; such are they also that are heavenly."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"049"|"And as we have borne the image of the earthy; we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"050"|"Now this I say; brethren; that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"051"|"Behold; I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep; but we shall all be changed;"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"052"|"In a moment; in the twinkling of an eye; at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound; and the dead shall be raised incorruptible; and we shall be changed."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"053"|"For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"054"|"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption; and this mortal shall have put on immortality; then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written; Death is swallowed up in victory."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"055"|"O death; where is thy sting? O grave; where is thy victory?"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"056"|"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"057"|"But thanks be to God; which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"15"|"058"|"Therefore; my beloved brethren; be ye stedfast; unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
                
    

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"001"|"Now concerning the collection for the saints; as I have given order to the churches of Galatia; even so do ye."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"002"|"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store; as God hath prospered him; that there be no gatherings when I come."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"003"|"And when I come; whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters; them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"004"|"And if it be meet that I go also; they shall go with me."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"005"|"Now I will come unto you; when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"006"|"And it may be that I will abide; yea; and winter with you; that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"007"|"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you; if the Lord permit."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"008"|"But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"009"|"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me; and there are many adversaries."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"010"|"Now if Timotheus come; see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord; as I also do."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"011"|"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace; that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"012"|"As touching our brother Apollos; I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"013"|"Watch ye; stand fast in the faith; quit you like men; be strong."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"014"|"Let all your things be done with charity."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"015"|"I beseech you; brethren; (ye know the house of Stephanas; that it is the firstfruits of Achaia; and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints;)"
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"016"|"That ye submit yourselves unto such; and to every one that helpeth with us; and laboureth."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"017"|"I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"018"|"For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"019"|"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord; with the church that is in their house."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"020"|"All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"021"|"The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"022"|"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ; let him be Anathema Maranatha."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"023"|"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
        

          "1Corinthians"|"46"|"16"|"024"|"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
