    Jude:
    

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"001"|"Jude; the servant of Jesus Christ; and brother of James; to them that are sanctified by God the Father; and preserved in Jesus Christ; and called:"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"002"|"Mercy unto you; and peace; and love; be multiplied."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"003"|"Beloved; when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation; it was needful for me to write unto you; and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"004"|"For there are certain men crept in unawares; who were before of old ordained to this condemnation; ungodly men; turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness; and denying the only Lord God; and our Lord Jesus Christ."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"005"|"I will therefore put you in remembrance; though ye once knew this; how that the Lord; having saved the people out of the land of Egypt; afterward destroyed them that believed not."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"006"|"And the angels which kept not their first estate; but left their own habitation; he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"007"|"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha; and the cities about them in like manner; giving themselves over to fornication; and going after strange flesh; are set forth for an example; suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"008"|"Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh; despise dominion; and speak evil of dignities."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"009"|"Yet Michael the archangel; when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses; durst not bring against him a railing accusation; but said; The Lord rebuke thee."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"010"|"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally; as brute beasts; in those things they corrupt themselves."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"011"|"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain; and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward; and perished in the gainsaying of Core."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"012"|"These are spots in your feasts of charity; when they feast with you; feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water; carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth; without fruit; twice dead; plucked up by the roots;"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"013"|"Raging waves of the sea; foaming out their own shame; wandering stars; to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"014"|"And Enoch also; the seventh from Adam; prophesied of these; saying; Behold; the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints;"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"015"|"To execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed; and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"016"|"These are murmurers; complainers; walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words; having men2019s persons in admiration because of advantage."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"017"|"But; beloved; remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"018"|"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time; who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"019"|"These be they who separate themselves; sensual; having not the Spirit."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"020"|"But ye; beloved; building up yourselves on your most holy faith; praying in the Holy Ghost;"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"021"|"Keep yourselves in the love of God; looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"022"|"And of some have compassion; making a difference:"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"023"|"And others save with fear; pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"024"|"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling; and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy;"
        

          "Jude"|"65"|"1"|"025"|"To the only wise God our Saviour; be glory and majesty; dominion and power; both now and ever. Amen."
