    Job:
    

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"001"|"There was a man in the land of Uz; whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright; and one that feared God; and eschewed evil."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"002"|"And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"003"|"His substance also was seven thousand sheep; and three thousand camels; and five hundred yoke of oxen; and five hundred she asses; and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"004"|"And his sons went and feasted in their houses; every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"005"|"And it was so; when the days of their feasting were gone about; that Job sent and sanctified them; and rose up early in the morning; and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said; It may be that my sons have sinned; and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"006"|"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD; and Satan came also among them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"007"|"And the LORD said unto Satan; Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD; and said; From going to and fro in the earth; and from walking up and down in it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"008"|"And the LORD said unto Satan; Hast thou considered my servant Job; that there is none like him in the earth; a perfect and an upright man; one that feareth God; and escheweth evil?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"009"|"Then Satan answered the LORD; and said; Doth Job fear God for nought?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"010"|"Hast not thou made an hedge about him; and about his house; and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands; and his substance is increased in the land."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"011"|"But put forth thine hand now; and touch all that he hath; and he will curse thee to thy face."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"012"|"And the LORD said unto Satan; Behold; all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"013"|"And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother2019s house:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"014"|"And there came a messenger unto Job; and said; The oxen were plowing; and the asses feeding beside them:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"015"|"And the Sabeans fell upon them; and took them away; yea; they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"016"|"While he was yet speaking; there came also another; and said; The fire of God is fallen from heaven; and hath burned up the sheep; and the servants; and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"017"|"While he was yet speaking; there came also another; and said; The Chaldeans made out three bands; and fell upon the camels; and have carried them away; yea; and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"018"|"While he was yet speaking; there came also another; and said; Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother2019s house:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"019"|"And; behold; there came a great wind from the wilderness; and smote the four corners of the house; and it fell upon the young men; and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"020"|"Then Job arose; and rent his mantle; and shaved his head; and fell down upon the ground; and worshipped;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"021"|"And said; Naked came I out of my mother2019s womb; and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave; and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"1"|"022"|"In all this Job sinned not; nor charged God foolishly."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"001"|"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD; and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"002"|"And the LORD said unto Satan; From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD; and said; From going to and fro in the earth; and from walking up and down in it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"003"|"And the LORD said unto Satan; Hast thou considered my servant Job; that there is none like him in the earth; a perfect and an upright man; one that feareth God; and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity; although thou movedst me against him; to destroy him without cause."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"004"|"And Satan answered the LORD; and said; Skin for skin; yea; all that a man hath will he give for his life."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"005"|"But put forth thine hand now; and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will curse thee to thy face."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"006"|"And the LORD said unto Satan; Behold; he is in thine hand; but save his life."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"007"|"So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD; and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"008"|"And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"009"|"Then said his wife unto him; Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God; and die."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"010"|"But he said unto her; Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God; and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"011"|"Now when Job2019s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him; they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite; and Bildad the Shuhite; and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"012"|"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off; and knew him not; they lifted up their voice; and wept; and they rent every one his mantle; and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"2"|"013"|"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights; and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"001"|"After this opened Job his mouth; and cursed his day."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"002"|"And Job spake; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"003"|"Let the day perish wherein I was born; and the night in which it was said; There is a man child conceived."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"004"|"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"005"|"Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"006"|"As for that night; let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"007"|"Lo; let that night be solitary; let no joyful voice come therein."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"008"|"Let them curse it that curse the day; who are ready to raise up their mourning."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"009"|"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light; but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"010"|"Because it shut not up the doors of my mother2019s womb; nor hid sorrow from mine eyes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"011"|"Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"012"|"Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"013"|"For now should I have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept: then had I been at rest;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"014"|"With kings and counsellors of the earth; which built desolate places for themselves;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"015"|"Or with princes that had gold; who filled their houses with silver:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"016"|"Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"017"|"There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"018"|"There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"019"|"The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"020"|"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery; and life unto the bitter in soul;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"021"|"Which long for death; but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"022"|"Which rejoice exceedingly; and are glad; when they can find the grave?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"023"|"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid; and whom God hath hedged in?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"024"|"For my sighing cometh before I eat; and my roarings are poured out like the waters."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"025"|"For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me; and that which I was afraid of is come unto me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"3"|"026"|"I was not in safety; neither had I rest; neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"001"|"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"002"|"If we assay to commune with thee; wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"003"|"Behold; thou hast instructed many; and thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"004"|"Thy words have upholden him that was falling; and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"005"|"But now it is come upon thee; and thou faintest; it toucheth thee; and thou art troubled."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"006"|"Is not this thy fear; thy confidence; thy hope; and the uprightness of thy ways?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"007"|"Remember; I pray thee; who ever perished; being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"008"|"Even as I have seen; they that plow iniquity; and sow wickedness; reap the same."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"009"|"By the blast of God they perish; and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"010"|"The roaring of the lion; and the voice of the fierce lion; and the teeth of the young lions; are broken."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"011"|"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey; and the stout lion2019s whelps are scattered abroad."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"012"|"Now a thing was secretly brought to me; and mine ear received a little thereof."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"013"|"In thoughts from the visions of the night; when deep sleep falleth on men;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"014"|"Fear came upon me; and trembling; which made all my bones to shake."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"015"|"Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"016"|"It stood still; but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes; there was silence; and I heard a voice; saying;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"017"|"Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"018"|"Behold; he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"019"|"How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay; whose foundation is in the dust; which are crushed before the moth?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"020"|"They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"4"|"021"|"Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die; even without wisdom."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"001"|"Call now; if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"002"|"For wrath killeth the foolish man; and envy slayeth the silly one."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"003"|"I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"004"|"His children are far from safety; and they are crushed in the gate; neither is there any to deliver them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"005"|"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up; and taketh it even out of the thorns; and the robber swalloweth up their substance."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"006"|"Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust; neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"007"|"Yet man is born unto trouble; as the sparks fly upward."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"008"|"I would seek unto God; and unto God would I commit my cause:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"009"|"Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"010"|"Who giveth rain upon the earth; and sendeth waters upon the fields:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"011"|"To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"012"|"He disappointeth the devices of the crafty; so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"013"|"He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"014"|"They meet with darkness in the day time; and grope in the noonday as in the night."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"015"|"But he saveth the poor from the sword; from their mouth; and from the hand of the mighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"016"|"So the poor hath hope; and iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"017"|"Behold; happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"018"|"For he maketh sore; and bindeth up: he woundeth; and his hands make whole."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"019"|"He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea; in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"020"|"In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"021"|"Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"022"|"At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"023"|"For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"024"|"And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation; and shalt not sin."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"025"|"Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great; and thine offspring as the grass of the earth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"026"|"Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age; like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"5"|"027"|"Lo this; we have searched it; so it is; hear it; and know thou it for thy good."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"001"|"But Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"002"|"Oh that my grief were throughly weighed; and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"003"|"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"004"|"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"005"|"Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"006"|"Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"007"|"The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"008"|"Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"009"|"Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand; and cut me off!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"010"|"Then should I yet have comfort; yea; I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"011"|"What is my strength; that I should hope? and what is mine end; that I should prolong my life?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"012"|"Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"013"|"Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"014"|"To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"015"|"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook; and as the stream of brooks they pass away;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"016"|"Which are blackish by reason of the ice; and wherein the snow is hid:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"017"|"What time they wax warm; they vanish: when it is hot; they are consumed out of their place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"018"|"The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing; and perish."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"019"|"The troops of Tema looked; the companies of Sheba waited for them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"020"|"They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither; and were ashamed."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"021"|"For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down; and are afraid."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"022"|"Did I say; Bring unto me? or; Give a reward for me of your substance?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"023"|"Or; Deliver me from the enemy2019s hand? or; Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"024"|"Teach me; and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"025"|"How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"026"|"Do ye imagine to reprove words; and the speeches of one that is desperate; which are as wind?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"027"|"Yea; ye overwhelm the fatherless; and ye dig a pit for your friend."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"028"|"Now therefore be content; look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"029"|"Return; I pray you; let it not be iniquity; yea; return again; my righteousness is in it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"6"|"030"|"Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?"
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"001"|"Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"002"|"As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow; and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"003"|"So am I made to possess months of vanity; and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"004"|"When I lie down; I say; When shall I arise; and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"005"|"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken; and become loathsome."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"006"|"My days are swifter than a weaver2019s shuttle; and are spent without hope."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"007"|"O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"008"|"The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me; and I am not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"009"|"As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"010"|"He shall return no more to his house; neither shall his place know him any more."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"011"|"Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"012"|"Am I a sea; or a whale; that thou settest a watch over me?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"013"|"When I say; My bed shall comfort me; my couch shall ease my complaint;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"014"|"Then thou scarest me with dreams; and terrifiest me through visions:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"015"|"So that my soul chooseth strangling; and death rather than my life."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"016"|"I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"017"|"What is man; that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"018"|"And that thou shouldest visit him every morning; and try him every moment?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"019"|"How long wilt thou not depart from me; nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"020"|"I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee; O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee; so that I am a burden to myself?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"7"|"021"|"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression; and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning; but I shall not be."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"001"|"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"002"|"How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"003"|"Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"004"|"If thy children have sinned against him; and he have cast them away for their transgression;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"005"|"If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes; and make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"006"|"If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee; and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"007"|"Though thy beginning was small; yet thy latter end should greatly increase."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"008"|"For enquire; I pray thee; of the former age; and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"009"|"(For we are but of yesterday; and know nothing; because our days upon earth are a shadow:)"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"010"|"Shall not they teach thee; and tell thee; and utter words out of their heart?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"011"|"Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"012"|"Whilst it is yet in his greenness; and not cut down; it withereth before any other herb."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"013"|"So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite2019s hope shall perish:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"014"|"Whose hope shall be cut off; and whose trust shall be a spider2019s web."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"015"|"He shall lean upon his house; but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast; but it shall not endure."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"016"|"He is green before the sun; and his branch shooteth forth in his garden."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"017"|"His roots are wrapped about the heap; and seeth the place of stones."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"018"|"If he destroy him from his place; then it shall deny him; saying; I have not seen thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"019"|"Behold; this is the joy of his way; and out of the earth shall others grow."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"020"|"Behold; God will not cast away a perfect man; neither will he help the evil doers:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"021"|"Till he fill thy mouth with laughing; and thy lips with rejoicing."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"8"|"022"|"They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"001"|"Then Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"002"|"I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"003"|"If he will contend with him; he cannot answer him one of a thousand."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"004"|"He is wise in heart; and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him; and hath prospered?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"005"|"Which removeth the mountains; and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"006"|"Which shaketh the earth out of her place; and the pillars thereof tremble."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"007"|"Which commandeth the sun; and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"008"|"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens; and treadeth upon the waves of the sea."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"009"|"Which maketh Arcturus; Orion; and Pleiades; and the chambers of the south."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"010"|"Which doeth great things past finding out; yea; and wonders without number."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"011"|"Lo; he goeth by me; and I see him not: he passeth on also; but I perceive him not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"012"|"Behold; he taketh away; who can hinder him? who will say unto him; What doest thou?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"013"|"If God will not withdraw his anger; the proud helpers do stoop under him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"014"|"How much less shall I answer him; and choose out my words to reason with him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"015"|"Whom; though I were righteous; yet would I not answer; but I would make supplication to my judge."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"016"|"If I had called; and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"017"|"For he breaketh me with a tempest; and multiplieth my wounds without cause."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"018"|"He will not suffer me to take my breath; but filleth me with bitterness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"019"|"If I speak of strength; lo; he is strong: and if of judgment; who shall set me a time to plead?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"020"|"If I justify myself; mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say; I am perfect; it shall also prove me perverse."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"021"|"Though I were perfect; yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"022"|"This is one thing; therefore I said it; He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"023"|"If the scourge slay suddenly; he will laugh at the trial of the innocent."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"024"|"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not; where; and who is he?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"025"|"Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away; they see no good."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"026"|"They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"027"|"If I say; I will forget my complaint; I will leave off my heaviness; and comfort myself:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"028"|"I am afraid of all my sorrows; I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"029"|"If I be wicked; why then labour I in vain?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"030"|"If I wash myself with snow water; and make my hands never so clean;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"031"|"Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch; and mine own clothes shall abhor me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"032"|"For he is not a man; as I am; that I should answer him; and we should come together in judgment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"033"|"Neither is there any daysman betwixt us; that might lay his hand upon us both."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"034"|"Let him take his rod away from me; and let not his fear terrify me:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"9"|"035"|"Then would I speak; and not fear him; but it is not so with me."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"001"|"My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"002"|"I will say unto God; Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"003"|"Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress; that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands; and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"004"|"Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"005"|"Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man2019s days;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"006"|"That thou enquirest after mine iniquity; and searchest after my sin?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"007"|"Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"008"|"Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"009"|"Remember; I beseech thee; that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"010"|"Hast thou not poured me out as milk; and curdled me like cheese?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"011"|"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh; and hast fenced me with bones and sinews."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"012"|"Thou hast granted me life and favour; and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"013"|"And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"014"|"If I sin; then thou markest me; and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"015"|"If I be wicked; woe unto me; and if I be righteous; yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"016"|"For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"017"|"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me; and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"018"|"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost; and no eye had seen me!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"019"|"I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"020"|"Are not my days few? cease then; and let me alone; that I may take comfort a little;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"021"|"Before I go whence I shall not return; even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"10"|"022"|"A land of darkness; as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death; without any order; and where the light is as darkness."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"001"|"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"002"|"Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"003"|"Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest; shall no man make thee ashamed?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"004"|"For thou hast said; My doctrine is pure; and I am clean in thine eyes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"005"|"But oh that God would speak; and open his lips against thee;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"006"|"And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom; that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"007"|"Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"008"|"It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"009"|"The measure thereof is longer than the earth; and broader than the sea."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"010"|"If he cut off; and shut up; or gather together; then who can hinder him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"011"|"For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"012"|"For vain man would be wise; though man be born like a wild ass2019s colt."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"013"|"If thou prepare thine heart; and stretch out thine hands toward him;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"014"|"If iniquity be in thine hand; put it far away; and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"015"|"For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea; thou shalt be stedfast; and shalt not fear:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"016"|"Because thou shalt forget thy misery; and remember it as waters that pass away:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"017"|"And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth; thou shalt be as the morning."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"018"|"And thou shalt be secure; because there is hope; yea; thou shalt dig about thee; and thou shalt take thy rest in safety."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"019"|"Also thou shalt lie down; and none shall make thee afraid; yea; many shall make suit unto thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"11"|"020"|"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail; and they shall not escape; and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"001"|"And Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"002"|"No doubt but ye are the people; and wisdom shall die with you."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"003"|"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea; who knoweth not such things as these?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"004"|"I am as one mocked of his neighbour; who calleth upon God; and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"005"|"He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"006"|"The tabernacles of robbers prosper; and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"007"|"But ask now the beasts; and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air; and they shall tell thee:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"008"|"Or speak to the earth; and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"009"|"Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"010"|"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing; and the breath of all mankind."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"011"|"Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"012"|"With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"013"|"With him is wisdom and strength; he hath counsel and understanding."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"014"|"Behold; he breaketh down; and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man; and there can be no opening."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"015"|"Behold; he withholdeth the waters; and they dry up: also he sendeth them out; and they overturn the earth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"016"|"With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"017"|"He leadeth counsellors away spoiled; and maketh the judges fools."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"018"|"He looseth the bond of kings; and girdeth their loins with a girdle."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"019"|"He leadeth princes away spoiled; and overthroweth the mighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"020"|"He removeth away the speech of the trusty; and taketh away the understanding of the aged."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"021"|"He poureth contempt upon princes; and weakeneth the strength of the mighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"022"|"He discovereth deep things out of darkness; and bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"023"|"He increaseth the nations; and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations; and straiteneth them again."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"024"|"He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth; and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"12"|"025"|"They grope in the dark without light; and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"001"|"Lo; mine eye hath seen all this; mine ear hath heard and understood it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"002"|"What ye know; the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"003"|"Surely I would speak to the Almighty; and I desire to reason with God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"004"|"But ye are forgers of lies; ye are all physicians of no value."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"005"|"O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"006"|"Hear now my reasoning; and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"007"|"Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"008"|"Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"009"|"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another; do ye so mock him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"010"|"He will surely reprove you; if ye do secretly accept persons."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"011"|"Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"012"|"Your remembrances are like unto ashes; your bodies to bodies of clay."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"013"|"Hold your peace; let me alone; that I may speak; and let come on me what will."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"014"|"Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth; and put my life in mine hand?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"015"|"Though he slay me; yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"016"|"He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"017"|"Hear diligently my speech; and my declaration with your ears."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"018"|"Behold now; I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"019"|"Who is he that will plead with me? for now; if I hold my tongue; I shall give up the ghost."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"020"|"Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"021"|"Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"022"|"Then call thou; and I will answer: or let me speak; and answer thou me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"023"|"How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"024"|"Wherefore hidest thou thy face; and holdest me for thine enemy?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"025"|"Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"026"|"For thou writest bitter things against me; and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"027"|"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks; and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"13"|"028"|"And he; as a rotten thing; consumeth; as a garment that is moth eaten."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"001"|"Man that is born of a woman is of few days; and full of trouble."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"002"|"He cometh forth like a flower; and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow; and continueth not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"003"|"And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one; and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"004"|"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"005"|"Seeing his days are determined; the number of his months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"006"|"Turn from him; that he may rest; till he shall accomplish; as an hireling; his day."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"007"|"For there is hope of a tree; if it be cut down; that it will sprout again; and that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"008"|"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth; and the stock thereof die in the ground;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"009"|"Yet through the scent of water it will bud; and bring forth boughs like a plant."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"010"|"But man dieth; and wasteth away: yea; man giveth up the ghost; and where is he?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"011"|"As the waters fail from the sea; and the flood decayeth and drieth up:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"012"|"So man lieth down; and riseth not: till the heavens be no more; they shall not awake; nor be raised out of their sleep."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"013"|"O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave; that thou wouldest keep me secret; until thy wrath be past; that thou wouldest appoint me a set time; and remember me!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"014"|"If a man die; shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait; till my change come."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"015"|"Thou shalt call; and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"016"|"For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"017"|"My transgression is sealed up in a bag; and thou sewest up mine iniquity."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"018"|"And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought; and the rock is removed out of his place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"019"|"The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"020"|"Thou prevailest for ever against him; and he passeth: thou changest his countenance; and sendest him away."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"021"|"His sons come to honour; and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low; but he perceiveth it not of them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"14"|"022"|"But his flesh upon him shall have pain; and his soul within him shall mourn."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"001"|"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"002"|"Should a wise man utter vain knowledge; and fill his belly with the east wind?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"003"|"Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"004"|"Yea; thou castest off fear; and restrainest prayer before God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"005"|"For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity; and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"006"|"Thine own mouth condemneth thee; and not I: yea; thine own lips testify against thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"007"|"Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"008"|"Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"009"|"What knowest thou; that we know not? what understandest thou; which is not in us?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"010"|"With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men; much elder than thy father."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"011"|"Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"012"|"Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"013"|"That thou turnest thy spirit against God; and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"014"|"What is man; that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman; that he should be righteous?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"015"|"Behold; he putteth no trust in his saints; yea; the heavens are not clean in his sight."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"016"|"How much more abominable and filthy is man; which drinketh iniquity like water?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"017"|"I will shew thee; hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"018"|"Which wise men have told from their fathers; and have not hid it:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"019"|"Unto whom alone the earth was given; and no stranger passed among them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"020"|"The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days; and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"021"|"A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"022"|"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness; and he is waited for of the sword."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"023"|"He wandereth abroad for bread; saying; Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"024"|"Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him; as a king ready to the battle."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"025"|"For he stretcheth out his hand against God; and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"026"|"He runneth upon him; even on his neck; upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"027"|"Because he covereth his face with his fatness; and maketh collops of fat on his flanks."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"028"|"And he dwelleth in desolate cities; and in houses which no man inhabiteth; which are ready to become heaps."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"029"|"He shall not be rich; neither shall his substance continue; neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"030"|"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches; and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"031"|"Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"032"|"It shall be accomplished before his time; and his branch shall not be green."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"033"|"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine; and shall cast off his flower as the olive."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"034"|"For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate; and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"15"|"035"|"They conceive mischief; and bring forth vanity; and their belly prepareth deceit."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"001"|"Then Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"002"|"I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"003"|"Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"004"|"I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul2019s stead; I could heap up words against you; and shake mine head at you."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"005"|"But I would strengthen you with my mouth; and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"006"|"Though I speak; my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear; what am I eased?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"007"|"But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"008"|"And thou hast filled me with wrinkles; which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"009"|"He teareth me in his wrath; who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"010"|"They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"011"|"God hath delivered me to the ungodly; and turned me over into the hands of the wicked."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"012"|"I was at ease; but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck; and shaken me to pieces; and set me up for his mark."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"013"|"His archers compass me round about; he cleaveth my reins asunder; and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"014"|"He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"015"|"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin; and defiled my horn in the dust."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"016"|"My face is foul with weeping; and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"017"|"Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"018"|"O earth; cover not thou my blood; and let my cry have no place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"019"|"Also now; behold; my witness is in heaven; and my record is on high."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"020"|"My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"021"|"O that one might plead for a man with God; as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"16"|"022"|"When a few years are come; then I shall go the way whence I shall not return."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"001"|"My breath is corrupt; my days are extinct; the graves are ready for me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"002"|"Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"003"|"Lay down now; put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"004"|"For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"005"|"He that speaketh flattery to his friends; even the eyes of his children shall fail."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"006"|"He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"007"|"Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow; and all my members are as a shadow."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"008"|"Upright men shall be astonied at this; and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"009"|"The righteous also shall hold on his way; and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"010"|"But as for you all; do ye return; and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"011"|"My days are past; my purposes are broken off; even the thoughts of my heart."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"012"|"They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"013"|"If I wait; the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"014"|"I have said to corruption; Thou art my father: to the worm; Thou art my mother; and my sister."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"015"|"And where is now my hope? as for my hope; who shall see it?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"17"|"016"|"They shall go down to the bars of the pit; when our rest together is in the dust."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"001"|"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"002"|"How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark; and afterwards we will speak."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"003"|"Wherefore are we counted as beasts; and reputed vile in your sight?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"004"|"He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"005"|"Yea; the light of the wicked shall be put out; and the spark of his fire shall not shine."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"006"|"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle; and his candle shall be put out with him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"007"|"The steps of his strength shall be straitened; and his own counsel shall cast him down."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"008"|"For he is cast into a net by his own feet; and he walketh upon a snare."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"009"|"The gin shall take him by the heel; and the robber shall prevail against him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"010"|"The snare is laid for him in the ground; and a trap for him in the way."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"011"|"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side; and shall drive him to his feet."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"012"|"His strength shall be hungerbitten; and destruction shall be ready at his side."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"013"|"It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"014"|"His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle; and it shall bring him to the king of terrors."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"015"|"It shall dwell in his tabernacle; because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"016"|"His roots shall be dried up beneath; and above shall his branch be cut off."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"017"|"His remembrance shall perish from the earth; and he shall have no name in the street."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"018"|"He shall be driven from light into darkness; and chased out of the world."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"019"|"He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people; nor any remaining in his dwellings."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"020"|"They that come after him shall be astonied at his day; as they that went before were affrighted."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"18"|"021"|"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked; and this is the place of him that knoweth not God."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"001"|"Then Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"002"|"How long will ye vex my soul; and break me in pieces with words?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"003"|"These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"004"|"And be it indeed that I have erred; mine error remaineth with myself."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"005"|"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me; and plead against me my reproach:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"006"|"Know now that God hath overthrown me; and hath compassed me with his net."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"007"|"Behold; I cry out of wrong; but I am not heard: I cry aloud; but there is no judgment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"008"|"He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass; and he hath set darkness in my paths."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"009"|"He hath stripped me of my glory; and taken the crown from my head."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"010"|"He hath destroyed me on every side; and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"011"|"He hath also kindled his wrath against me; and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"012"|"His troops come together; and raise up their way against me; and encamp round about my tabernacle."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"013"|"He hath put my brethren far from me; and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"014"|"My kinsfolk have failed; and my familiar friends have forgotten me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"015"|"They that dwell in mine house; and my maids; count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"016"|"I called my servant; and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"017"|"My breath is strange to my wife; though I intreated for the children2019s sake of mine own body."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"018"|"Yea; young children despised me; I arose; and they spake against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"019"|"All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"020"|"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh; and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"021"|"Have pity upon me; have pity upon me; O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"022"|"Why do ye persecute me as God; and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"023"|"Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"024"|"That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"025"|"For I know that my redeemer liveth; and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"026"|"And though after my skin worms destroy this body; yet in my flesh shall I see God:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"027"|"Whom I shall see for myself; and mine eyes shall behold; and not another; though my reins be consumed within me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"028"|"But ye should say; Why persecute we him; seeing the root of the matter is found in me?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"19"|"029"|"Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword; that ye may know there is a judgment."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"001"|"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"002"|"Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer; and for this I make haste."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"003"|"I have heard the check of my reproach; and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"004"|"Knowest thou not this of old; since man was placed upon earth;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"005"|"That the triumphing of the wicked is short; and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"006"|"Though his excellency mount up to the heavens; and his head reach unto the clouds;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"007"|"Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say; Where is he?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"008"|"He shall fly away as a dream; and shall not be found: yea; he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"009"|"The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"010"|"His children shall seek to please the poor; and his hands shall restore their goods."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"011"|"His bones are full of the sin of his youth; which shall lie down with him in the dust."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"012"|"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth; though he hide it under his tongue;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"013"|"Though he spare it; and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"014"|"Yet his meat in his bowels is turned; it is the gall of asps within him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"015"|"He hath swallowed down riches; and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"016"|"He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper2019s tongue shall slay him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"017"|"He shall not see the rivers; the floods; the brooks of honey and butter."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"018"|"That which he laboured for shall he restore; and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be; and he shall not rejoice therein."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"019"|"Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"020"|"Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly; he shall not save of that which he desired."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"021"|"There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"022"|"In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"023"|"When he is about to fill his belly; God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him; and shall rain it upon him while he is eating."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"024"|"He shall flee from the iron weapon; and the bow of steel shall strike him through."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"025"|"It is drawn; and cometh out of the body; yea; the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"026"|"All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"027"|"The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"028"|"The increase of his house shall depart; and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"20"|"029"|"This is the portion of a wicked man from God; and the heritage appointed unto him by God."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"001"|"But Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"002"|"Hear diligently my speech; and let this be your consolations."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"003"|"Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken; mock on."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"004"|"As for me; is my complaint to man? and if it were so; why should not my spirit be troubled?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"005"|"Mark me; and be astonished; and lay your hand upon your mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"006"|"Even when I remember I am afraid; and trembling taketh hold on my flesh."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"007"|"Wherefore do the wicked live; become old; yea; are mighty in power?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"008"|"Their seed is established in their sight with them; and their offspring before their eyes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"009"|"Their houses are safe from fear; neither is the rod of God upon them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"010"|"Their bull gendereth; and faileth not; their cow calveth; and casteth not her calf."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"011"|"They send forth their little ones like a flock; and their children dance."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"012"|"They take the timbrel and harp; and rejoice at the sound of the organ."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"013"|"They spend their days in wealth; and in a moment go down to the grave."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"014"|"Therefore they say unto God; Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"015"|"What is the Almighty; that we should serve him? and what profit should we have; if we pray unto him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"016"|"Lo; their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"017"|"How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"018"|"They are as stubble before the wind; and as chaff that the storm carrieth away."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"019"|"God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him; and he shall know it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"020"|"His eyes shall see his destruction; and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"021"|"For what pleasure hath he in his house after him; when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"022"|"Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"023"|"One dieth in his full strength; being wholly at ease and quiet."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"024"|"His breasts are full of milk; and his bones are moistened with marrow."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"025"|"And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul; and never eateth with pleasure."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"026"|"They shall lie down alike in the dust; and the worms shall cover them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"027"|"Behold; I know your thoughts; and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"028"|"For ye say; Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"029"|"Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"030"|"That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"031"|"Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"032"|"Yet shall he be brought to the grave; and shall remain in the tomb."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"033"|"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him; and every man shall draw after him; as there are innumerable before him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"21"|"034"|"How then comfort ye me in vain; seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?"
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"001"|"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"002"|"Can a man be profitable unto God; as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"003"|"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty; that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him; that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"004"|"Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"005"|"Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"006"|"For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought; and stripped the naked of their clothing."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"007"|"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink; and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"008"|"But as for the mighty man; he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"009"|"Thou hast sent widows away empty; and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"010"|"Therefore snares are round about thee; and sudden fear troubleth thee;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"011"|"Or darkness; that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"012"|"Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars; how high they are!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"013"|"And thou sayest; How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"014"|"Thick clouds are a covering to him; that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"015"|"Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"016"|"Which were cut down out of time; whose foundation was overflown with a flood:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"017"|"Which said unto God; Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"018"|"Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"019"|"The righteous see it; and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"020"|"Whereas our substance is not cut down; but the remnant of them the fire consumeth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"021"|"Acquaint now thyself with him; and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"022"|"Receive; I pray thee; the law from his mouth; and lay up his words in thine heart."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"023"|"If thou return to the Almighty; thou shalt be built up; thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"024"|"Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust; and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"025"|"Yea; the Almighty shall be thy defence; and thou shalt have plenty of silver."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"026"|"For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty; and shalt lift up thy face unto God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"027"|"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him; and he shall hear thee; and thou shalt pay thy vows."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"028"|"Thou shalt also decree a thing; and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"029"|"When men are cast down; then thou shalt say; There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"22"|"030"|"He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"001"|"Then Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"002"|"Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"003"|"Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"004"|"I would order my cause before him; and fill my mouth with arguments."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"005"|"I would know the words which he would answer me; and understand what he would say unto me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"006"|"Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"007"|"There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"008"|"Behold; I go forward; but he is not there; and backward; but I cannot perceive him:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"009"|"On the left hand; where he doth work; but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand; that I cannot see him:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"010"|"But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me; I shall come forth as gold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"011"|"My foot hath held his steps; his way have I kept; and not declined."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"012"|"Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"013"|"But he is in one mind; and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth; even that he doeth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"014"|"For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"015"|"Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider; I am afraid of him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"016"|"For God maketh my heart soft; and the Almighty troubleth me:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"23"|"017"|"Because I was not cut off before the darkness; neither hath he covered the darkness from my face."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"001"|"Why; seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty; do they that know him not see his days?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"002"|"Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks; and feed thereof."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"003"|"They drive away the ass of the fatherless; they take the widow2019s ox for a pledge."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"004"|"They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"005"|"Behold; as wild asses in the desert; go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"006"|"They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"007"|"They cause the naked to lodge without clothing; that they have no covering in the cold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"008"|"They are wet with the showers of the mountains; and embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"009"|"They pluck the fatherless from the breast; and take a pledge of the poor."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"010"|"They cause him to go naked without clothing; and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"011"|"Which make oil within their walls; and tread their winepresses; and suffer thirst."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"012"|"Men groan from out of the city; and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"013"|"They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof; nor abide in the paths thereof."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"014"|"The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy; and in the night is as a thief."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"015"|"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight; saying; No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"016"|"In the dark they dig through houses; which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"017"|"For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them; they are in the terrors of the shadow of death."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"018"|"He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"019"|"Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"020"|"The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"021"|"He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"022"|"He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up; and no man is sure of life."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"023"|"Though it be given him to be in safety; whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"024"|"They are exalted for a little while; but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other; and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"24"|"025"|"And if it be not so now; who will make me a liar; and make my speech nothing worth?"
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"25"|"001"|"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"25"|"002"|"Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high places."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"25"|"003"|"Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"25"|"004"|"How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"25"|"005"|"Behold even to the moon; and it shineth not; yea; the stars are not pure in his sight."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"25"|"006"|"How much less man; that is a worm? and the son of man; which is a worm?"
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"001"|"But Job answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"002"|"How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"003"|"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"004"|"To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"005"|"Dead things are formed from under the waters; and the inhabitants thereof."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"006"|"Hell is naked before him; and destruction hath no covering."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"007"|"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place; and hangeth the earth upon nothing."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"008"|"He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"009"|"He holdeth back the face of his throne; and spreadeth his cloud upon it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"010"|"He hath compassed the waters with bounds; until the day and night come to an end."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"011"|"The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"012"|"He divideth the sea with his power; and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"013"|"By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"26"|"014"|"Lo; these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"001"|"Moreover Job continued his parable; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"002"|"As God liveth; who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty; who hath vexed my soul;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"003"|"All the while my breath is in me; and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;"

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"005"|"God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"006"|"My righteousness I hold fast; and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"007"|"Let mine enemy be as the wicked; and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"008"|"For what is the hope of the hypocrite; though he hath gained; when God taketh away his soul?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"009"|"Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"010"|"Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"011"|"I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"012"|"Behold; all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"013"|"This is the portion of a wicked man with God; and the heritage of oppressors; which they shall receive of the Almighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"014"|"If his children be multiplied; it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"015"|"Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"016"|"Though he heap up silver as the dust; and prepare raiment as the clay;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"017"|"He may prepare it; but the just shall put it on; and the innocent shall divide the silver."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"018"|"He buildeth his house as a moth; and as a booth that the keeper maketh."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"019"|"The rich man shall lie down; but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes; and he is not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"020"|"Terrors take hold on him as waters; a tempest stealeth him away in the night."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"021"|"The east wind carrieth him away; and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"022"|"For God shall cast upon him; and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"27"|"023"|"Men shall clap their hands at him; and shall hiss him out of his place."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"001"|"Surely there is a vein for the silver; and a place for gold where they fine it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"002"|"Iron is taken out of the earth; and brass is molten out of the stone."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"003"|"He setteth an end to darkness; and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness; and the shadow of death."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"004"|"The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up; they are gone away from men."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"005"|"As for the earth; out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"006"|"The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"007"|"There is a path which no fowl knoweth; and which the vulture2019s eye hath not seen:"

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"009"|"He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"010"|"He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"011"|"He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"012"|"But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"013"|"Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living."

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"015"|"It cannot be gotten for gold; neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"016"|"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir; with the precious onyx; or the sapphire."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"017"|"The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"018"|"No mention shall be made of coral; or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"019"|"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it; neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"020"|"Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"021"|"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living; and kept close from the fowls of the air."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"28"|"022"|"Destruction and death say; We have heard the fame thereof with our ears."

          "Job"|"18"|"29"|"011"|"When the ear heard me; then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me; it gave witness to me:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"29"|"012"|"Because I delivered the poor that cried; and the fatherless; and him that had none to help him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"29"|"013"|"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow2019s heart to sing for joy."

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"009"|"And now am I their song; yea; I am their byword."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"010"|"They abhor me; they flee far from me; and spare not to spit in my face."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"011"|"Because he hath loosed my cord; and afflicted me; they have also let loose the bridle before me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"012"|"Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet; and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"013"|"They mar my path; they set forward my calamity; they have no helper."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"014"|"They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"015"|"Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"016"|"And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"017"|"My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"018"|"By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"019"|"He hath cast me into the mire; and I am become like dust and ashes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"020"|"I cry unto thee; and thou dost not hear me: I stand up; and thou regardest me not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"021"|"Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"022"|"Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it; and dissolvest my substance."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"023"|"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death; and to the house appointed for all living."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"024"|"Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave; though they cry in his destruction."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"025"|"Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"026"|"When I looked for good; then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light; there came darkness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"027"|"My bowels boiled; and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"028"|"I went mourning without the sun: I stood up; and I cried in the congregation."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"029"|"I am a brother to dragons; and a companion to owls."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"030"|"My skin is black upon me; and my bones are burned with heat."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"30"|"031"|"My harp also is turned to mourning; and my organ into the voice of them that weep."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"001"|"I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"002"|"For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"003"|"Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"004"|"Doth not he see my ways; and count all my steps?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"005"|"If I have walked with vanity; or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"006"|"Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"007"|"If my step hath turned out of the way; and mine heart walked after mine eyes; and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"008"|"Then let me sow; and let another eat; yea; let my offspring be rooted out."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"009"|"If mine heart have been deceived by a woman; or if I have laid wait at my neighbour2019s door;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"010"|"Then let my wife grind unto another; and let others bow down upon her."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"011"|"For this is an heinous crime; yea; it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"012"|"For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction; and would root out all mine increase."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"013"|"If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant; when they contended with me;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"014"|"What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth; what shall I answer him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"015"|"Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"016"|"If I have withheld the poor from their desire; or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"017"|"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone; and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"018"|"(For from my youth he was brought up with me; as with a father; and I have guided her from my mother2019s womb;)"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"019"|"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing; or any poor without covering;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"020"|"If his loins have not blessed me; and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"021"|"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless; when I saw my help in the gate:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"022"|"Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade; and mine arm be broken from the bone."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"023"|"For destruction from God was a terror to me; and by reason of his highness I could not endure."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"024"|"If I have made gold my hope; or have said to the fine gold; Thou art my confidence;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"025"|"If I rejoiced because my wealth was great; and because mine hand had gotten much;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"026"|"If I beheld the sun when it shined; or the moon walking in brightness;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"027"|"And my heart hath been secretly enticed; or my mouth hath kissed my hand:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"028"|"This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"029"|"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me; or lifted up myself when evil found him:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"030"|"Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"031"|"If the men of my tabernacle said not; Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"032"|"The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"033"|"If I covered my transgressions as Adam; by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"034"|"Did I fear a great multitude; or did the contempt of families terrify me; that I kept silence; and went not out of the door?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"035"|"Oh that one would hear me! behold; my desire is; that the Almighty would answer me; and that mine adversary had written a book."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"036"|"Surely I would take it upon my shoulder; and bind it as a crown to me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"037"|"I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"038"|"If my land cry against me; or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"039"|"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money; or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"31"|"040"|"Let thistles grow instead of wheat; and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"001"|"So these three men ceased to answer Job; because he was righteous in his own eyes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"002"|"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite; of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled; because he justified himself rather than God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"003"|"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled; because they had found no answer; and yet had condemned Job."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"004"|"Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken; because they were elder than he."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"005"|"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men; then his wrath was kindled."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"006"|"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said; I am young; and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid; and durst not shew you mine opinion."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"007"|"I said; Days should speak; and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"008"|"But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"009"|"Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"010"|"Therefore I said; Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"011"|"Behold; I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons; whilst ye searched out what to say."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"012"|"Yea; I attended unto you; and; behold; there was none of you that convinced Job; or that answered his words:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"013"|"Lest ye should say; We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down; not man."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"014"|"Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"015"|"They were amazed; they answered no more: they left off speaking."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"016"|"When I had waited; (for they spake not; but stood still; and answered no more;)"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"017"|"I said; I will answer also my part; I also will shew mine opinion."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"018"|"For I am full of matter; the spirit within me constraineth me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"019"|"Behold; my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"020"|"I will speak; that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"021"|"Let me not; I pray you; accept any man2019s person; neither let me give flattering titles unto man."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"32"|"022"|"For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"001"|"Wherefore; Job; I pray thee; hear my speeches; and hearken to all my words."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"002"|"Behold; now I have opened my mouth; my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"003"|"My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"004"|"The spirit of God hath made me; and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"005"|"If thou canst answer me; set thy words in order before me; stand up."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"006"|"Behold; I am according to thy wish in God2019s stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"007"|"Behold; my terror shall not make thee afraid; neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"008"|"Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing; and I have heard the voice of thy words; saying;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"009"|"I am clean without transgression; I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"010"|"Behold; he findeth occasions against me; he counteth me for his enemy;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"011"|"He putteth my feet in the stocks; he marketh all my paths."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"012"|"Behold; in this thou art not just: I will answer thee; that God is greater than man."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"013"|"Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"014"|"For God speaketh once; yea twice; yet man perceiveth it not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"015"|"In a dream; in a vision of the night; when deep sleep falleth upon men; in slumberings upon the bed;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"016"|"Then he openeth the ears of men; and sealeth their instruction;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"017"|"That he may withdraw man from his purpose; and hide pride from man."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"018"|"He keepeth back his soul from the pit; and his life from perishing by the sword."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"019"|"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed; and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"020"|"So that his life abhorreth bread; and his soul dainty meat."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"021"|"His flesh is consumed away; that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"022"|"Yea; his soul draweth near unto the grave; and his life to the destroyers."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"023"|"If there be a messenger with him; an interpreter; one among a thousand; to shew unto man his uprightness:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"024"|"Then he is gracious unto him; and saith; Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"025"|"His flesh shall be fresher than a child2019s: he shall return to the days of his youth:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"026"|"He shall pray unto God; and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"027"|"He looketh upon men; and if any say; I have sinned; and perverted that which was right; and it profited me not;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"028"|"He will deliver his soul from going into the pit; and his life shall see the light."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"029"|"Lo; all these things worketh God oftentimes with man;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"030"|"To bring back his soul from the pit; to be enlightened with the light of the living."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"031"|"Mark well; O Job; hearken unto me: hold thy peace; and I will speak."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"032"|"If thou hast anything to say; answer me: speak; for I desire to justify thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"33"|"033"|"If not; hearken unto me: hold thy peace; and I shall teach thee wisdom."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"001"|"Furthermore Elihu answered and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"002"|"Hear my words; O ye wise men; and give ear unto me; ye that have knowledge."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"003"|"For the ear trieth words; as the mouth tasteth meat."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"004"|"Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"005"|"For Job hath said; I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"006"|"Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"007"|"What man is like Job; who drinketh up scorning like water?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"008"|"Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity; and walketh with wicked men."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"009"|"For he hath said; It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"010"|"Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God; that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty; that he should commit iniquity."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"011"|"For the work of a man shall he render unto him; and cause every man to find according to his ways."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"012"|"Yea; surely God will not do wickedly; neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"013"|"Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"014"|"If he set his heart upon man; if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"015"|"All flesh shall perish together; and man shall turn again unto dust."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"016"|"If now thou hast understanding; hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"017"|"Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"018"|"Is it fit to say to a king; Thou art wicked? and to princes; Ye are ungodly?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"019"|"How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes; nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"020"|"In a moment shall they die; and the people shall be troubled at midnight; and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"021"|"For his eyes are upon the ways of man; and he seeth all his goings."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"022"|"There is no darkness; nor shadow of death; where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"023"|"For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"024"|"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number; and set others in their stead."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"025"|"Therefore he knoweth their works; and he overturneth them in the night; so that they are destroyed."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"026"|"He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"027"|"Because they turned back from him; and would not consider any of his ways:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"028"|"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him; and he heareth the cry of the afflicted."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"029"|"When he giveth quietness; who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face; who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation; or against a man only:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"030"|"That the hypocrite reign not; lest the people be ensnared."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"031"|"Surely it is meet to be said unto God; I have borne chastisement; I will not offend any more:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"032"|"That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity; I will do no more."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"033"|"Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it; whether thou refuse; or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"034"|"Let men of understanding tell me; and let a wise man hearken unto me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"035"|"Job hath spoken without knowledge; and his words were without wisdom."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"036"|"My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"34"|"037"|"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; he clappeth his hands among us; and multiplieth his words against God."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"001"|"Elihu spake moreover; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"002"|"Thinkest thou this to be right; that thou saidst; My righteousness is more than God2019s?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"003"|"For thou saidst; What advantage will it be unto thee? and; What profit shall I have; if I be cleansed from my sin?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"004"|"I will answer thee; and thy companions with thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"005"|"Look unto the heavens; and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"006"|"If thou sinnest; what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied; what doest thou unto him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"007"|"If thou be righteous; what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"008"|"Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"009"|"By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"010"|"But none saith; Where is God my maker; who giveth songs in the night;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"011"|"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth; and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"012"|"There they cry; but none giveth answer; because of the pride of evil men."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"013"|"Surely God will not hear vanity; neither will the Almighty regard it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"014"|"Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him; yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"015"|"But now; because it is not so; he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"35"|"016"|"Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"001"|"Elihu also proceeded; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"002"|"Suffer me a little; and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God2019s behalf."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"003"|"I will fetch my knowledge from afar; and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"004"|"For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"005"|"Behold; God is mighty; and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"006"|"He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"007"|"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea; he doth establish them for ever; and they are exalted."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"008"|"And if they be bound in fetters; and be holden in cords of affliction;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"009"|"Then he sheweth them their work; and their transgressions that they have exceeded."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"010"|"He openeth also their ear to discipline; and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"011"|"If they obey and serve him; they shall spend their days in prosperity; and their years in pleasures."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"012"|"But if they obey not; they shall perish by the sword; and they shall die without knowledge."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"013"|"But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"014"|"They die in youth; and their life is among the unclean."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"015"|"He delivereth the poor in his affliction; and openeth their ears in oppression."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"016"|"Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place; where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"017"|"But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"018"|"Because there is wrath; beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"019"|"Will he esteem thy riches? no; not gold; nor all the forces of strength."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"020"|"Desire not the night; when people are cut off in their place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"021"|"Take heed; regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"022"|"Behold; God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"023"|"Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say; Thou hast wrought iniquity?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"024"|"Remember that thou magnify his work; which men behold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"025"|"Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"026"|"Behold; God is great; and we know him not; neither can the number of his years be searched out."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"027"|"For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"028"|"Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"029"|"Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds; or the noise of his tabernacle?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"030"|"Behold; he spreadeth his light upon it; and covereth the bottom of the sea."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"031"|"For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"032"|"With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"36"|"033"|"The noise thereof sheweth concerning it; the cattle also concerning the vapour."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"001"|"At this also my heart trembleth; and is moved out of his place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"002"|"Hear attentively the noise of his voice; and the sound that goeth out of his mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"003"|"He directeth it under the whole heaven; and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"004"|"After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"005"|"God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he; which we cannot comprehend."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"006"|"For he saith to the snow; Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain; and to the great rain of his strength."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"007"|"He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"008"|"Then the beasts go into dens; and remain in their places."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"009"|"Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"010"|"By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"011"|"Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"012"|"And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"013"|"He causeth it to come; whether for correction; or for his land; or for mercy."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"014"|"Hearken unto this; O Job: stand still; and consider the wondrous works of God."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"015"|"Dost thou know when God disposed them; and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"016"|"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds; the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"017"|"How thy garments are warm; when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"018"|"Hast thou with him spread out the sky; which is strong; and as a molten looking glass?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"019"|"Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"020"|"Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak; surely he shall be swallowed up."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"021"|"And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth; and cleanseth them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"022"|"Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"023"|"Touching the Almighty; we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power; and in judgment; and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"37"|"024"|"Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"001"|"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"002"|"Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"003"|"Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee; and answer thou me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"004"|"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare; if thou hast understanding."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"005"|"Who hath laid the measures thereof; if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"006"|"Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"007"|"When the morning stars sang together; and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"008"|"Or who shut up the sea with doors; when it brake forth; as if it had issued out of the womb?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"009"|"When I made the cloud the garment thereof; and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"010"|"And brake up for it my decreed place; and set bars and doors;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"011"|"And said; Hitherto shalt thou come; but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"012"|"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"013"|"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth; that the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"014"|"It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"015"|"And from the wicked their light is withholden; and the high arm shall be broken."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"016"|"Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"017"|"Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"018"|"Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"019"|"Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness; where is the place thereof;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"020"|"That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof; and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"021"|"Knowest thou it; because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"022"|"Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"023"|"Which I have reserved against the time of trouble; against the day of battle and war?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"024"|"By what way is the light parted; which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"025"|"Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters; or a way for the lightning of thunder;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"026"|"To cause it to rain on the earth; where no man is; on the wilderness; wherein there is no man;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"027"|"To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"028"|"Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"029"|"Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven; who hath gendered it?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"030"|"The waters are hid as with a stone; and the face of the deep is frozen."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"031"|"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades; or loose the bands of Orion?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"032"|"Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?"

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"035"|"Canst thou send lightnings; that they may go; and say unto thee; Here we are?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"036"|"Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"037"|"Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"038"|"When the dust groweth into hardness; and the clods cleave fast together?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"38"|"039"|"Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions;"

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"010"|"Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"011"|"Wilt thou trust him; because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"012"|"Wilt thou believe him; that he will bring home thy seed; and gather it into thy barn?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"013"|"Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"014"|"Which leaveth her eggs in the earth; and warmeth them in dust;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"015"|"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them; or that the wild beast may break them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"016"|"She is hardened against her young ones; as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"017"|"Because God hath deprived her of wisdom; neither hath he imparted to her understanding."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"018"|"What time she lifteth up herself on high; she scorneth the horse and his rider."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"019"|"Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"020"|"Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"021"|"He paweth in the valley; and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"022"|"He mocketh at fear; and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"023"|"The quiver rattleth against him; the glittering spear and the shield."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"024"|"He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"025"|"He saith among the trumpets; Ha; ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off; the thunder of the captains; and the shouting."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"026"|"Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom; and stretch her wings toward the south?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"027"|"Doth the eagle mount up at thy command; and make her nest on high?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"028"|"She dwelleth and abideth on the rock; upon the crag of the rock; and the strong place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"029"|"From thence she seeketh the prey; and her eyes behold afar off."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"39"|"030"|"Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are; there is she."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"001"|"Moreover the LORD answered Job; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"002"|"Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God; let him answer it."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"003"|"Then Job answered the LORD; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"004"|"Behold; I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"005"|"Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea; twice; but I will proceed no further."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"006"|"Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"007"|"Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee; and declare thou unto me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"008"|"Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me; that thou mayest be righteous?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"009"|"Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"010"|"Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"011"|"Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud; and abase him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"012"|"Look on every one that is proud; and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"013"|"Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"014"|"Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"015"|"Behold now behemoth; which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"016"|"Lo now; his strength is in his loins; and his force is in the navel of his belly."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"017"|"He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"018"|"His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"019"|"He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"020"|"Surely the mountains bring him forth food; where all the beasts of the field play."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"021"|"He lieth under the shady trees; in the covert of the reed; and fens."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"022"|"The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"023"|"Behold; he drinketh up a river; and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"40"|"024"|"He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"001"|"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"002"|"Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"003"|"Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"004"|"Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"005"|"Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"006"|"Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"007"|"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"008"|"Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle; do no more."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"009"|"Behold; the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"010"|"None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"011"|"Who hath prevented me; that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"012"|"I will not conceal his parts; nor his power; nor his comely proportion."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"013"|"Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"014"|"Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"015"|"His scales are his pride; shut up together as with a close seal."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"016"|"One is so near to another; that no air can come between them."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"017"|"They are joined one to another; they stick together; that they cannot be sundered."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"018"|"By his neesings a light doth shine; and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"019"|"Out of his mouth go burning lamps; and sparks of fire leap out."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"020"|"Out of his nostrils goeth smoke; as out of a seething pot or caldron."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"021"|"His breath kindleth coals; and a flame goeth out of his mouth."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"022"|"In his neck remaineth strength; and sorrow is turned into joy before him."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"023"|"The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"024"|"His heart is as firm as a stone; yea; as hard as a piece of the nether millstone."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"025"|"When he raiseth up himself; the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"026"|"The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear; the dart; nor the habergeon."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"027"|"He esteemeth iron as straw; and brass as rotten wood."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"028"|"The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"029"|"Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"030"|"Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"031"|"He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"032"|"He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"033"|"Upon earth there is not his like; who is made without fear."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"41"|"034"|"He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride."
                
    

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"001"|"Then Job answered the LORD; and said;"
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"002"|"I know that thou canst do every thing; and that no thought can be withholden from thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"003"|"Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me; which I knew not."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"004"|"Hear; I beseech thee; and I will speak: I will demand of thee; and declare thou unto me."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"005"|"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"006"|"Wherefore I abhor myself; and repent in dust and ashes."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"007"|"And it was so; that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job; the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite; My wrath is kindled against thee; and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right; as my servant Job hath."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"008"|"Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams; and go to my servant Job; and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly; in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right; like my servant Job."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"009"|"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went; and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"010"|"And the LORD turned the captivity of Job; when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"011"|"Then came there unto him all his brethren; and all his sisters; and all they that had been of his acquaintance before; and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him; and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money; and every one an earring of gold."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"012"|"So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep; and six thousand camels; and a thousand yoke of oxen; and a thousand she asses."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"013"|"He had also seven sons and three daughters."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"014"|"And he called the name of the first; Jemima; and the name of the second; Kezia; and the name of the third; Kerenhappuch."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"015"|"And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"016"|"After this lived Job an hundred and forty years; and saw his sons; and his sons2019 sons; even four generations."
        

          "Job"|"18"|"42"|"017"|"So Job died; being old and full of days."
