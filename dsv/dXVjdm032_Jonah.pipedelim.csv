    Jonah:
    

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"001"|"Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai; saying;"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"002"|"Arise; go to Nineveh; that great city; and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"003"|"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD; and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof; and went down into it; to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"004"|"But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea; and there was a mighty tempest in the sea; so that the ship was like to be broken."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"005"|"Then the mariners were afraid; and cried every man unto his god; and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea; to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay; and was fast asleep."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"006"|"So the shipmaster came to him; and said unto him; What meanest thou; O sleeper? arise; call upon thy God; if so be that God will think upon us; that we perish not."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"007"|"And they said every one to his fellow; Come; and let us cast lots; that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots; and the lot fell upon Jonah."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"008"|"Then said they unto him; Tell us; we pray thee; for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"009"|"And he said unto them; I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD; the God of heaven; which hath made the sea and the dry land."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"010"|"Then were the men exceedingly afraid; and said unto him; Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD; because he had told them."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"011"|"Then said they unto him; What shall we do unto thee; that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought; and was tempestuous."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"012"|"And he said unto them; Take me up; and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"013"|"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought; and was tempestuous against them."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"014"|"Wherefore they cried unto the LORD; and said; We beseech thee; O LORD; we beseech thee; let us not perish for this man2019s life; and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou; O LORD; hast done as it pleased thee."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"015"|"So they took up Jonah; and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"016"|"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly; and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD; and made vows."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"1"|"017"|"Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."
                
    

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"001"|"Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish2019s belly;"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"002"|"And said; I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD; and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I; and thou heardest my voice."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"003"|"For thou hadst cast me into the deep; in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"004"|"Then I said; I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"005"|"The waters compassed me about; even to the soul: the depth closed me round about; the weeds were wrapped about my head."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"006"|"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption; O LORD my God."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"007"|"When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee; into thine holy temple."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"008"|"They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"009"|"But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"2"|"010"|"And the LORD spake unto the fish; and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land."
                
    

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"001"|"And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time; saying;"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"002"|"Arise; go unto Nineveh; that great city; and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"003"|"So Jonah arose; and went unto Nineveh; according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"004"|"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day2019s journey; and he cried; and said; Yet forty days; and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"005"|"So the people of Nineveh believed God; and proclaimed a fast; and put on sackcloth; from the greatest of them even to the least of them."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"006"|"For word came unto the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne; and he laid his robe from him; and covered him with sackcloth; and sat in ashes."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"007"|"And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles; saying; Let neither man nor beast; herd nor flock; taste any thing: let them not feed; nor drink water:"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"008"|"But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth; and cry mightily unto God: yea; let them turn every one from his evil way; and from the violence that is in their hands."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"009"|"Who can tell if God will turn and repent; and turn away from his fierce anger; that we perish not?"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"3"|"010"|"And God saw their works; that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil; that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not."
                
    

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"001"|"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly; and he was very angry."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"002"|"And he prayed unto the LORD; and said; I pray thee; O LORD; was not this my saying; when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God; and merciful; slow to anger; and of great kindness; and repentest thee of the evil."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"003"|"Therefore now; O LORD; take; I beseech thee; my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"004"|"Then said the LORD; Doest thou well to be angry?"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"005"|"So Jonah went out of the city; and sat on the east side of the city; and there made him a booth; and sat under it in the shadow; till he might see what would become of the city."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"006"|"And the LORD God prepared a gourd; and made it to come up over Jonah; that it might be a shadow over his head; to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"007"|"But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day; and it smote the gourd that it withered."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"008"|"And it came to pass; when the sun did arise; that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah; that he fainted; and wished in himself to die; and said; It is better for me to die than to live."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"009"|"And God said to Jonah; Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said; I do well to be angry; even unto death."
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"010"|"Then said the LORD; Thou hast had pity on the gourd; for the which thou hast not laboured; neither madest it grow; which came up in a night; and perished in a night:"
        

          "Jonah"|"32"|"4"|"011"|"And should not I spare Nineveh; that great city; wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?"
